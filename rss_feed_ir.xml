Rivers burst their banks, inundating a vast swath of agricultural land and densely populated areas. The Yangtze, Huai, and Yellow Rivers, known for their volatile natures, contributed significantly to the flooding. Estimates suggest that the disaster claimed between 1 to 4 million lives either directly through drowning or indirectly due to subsequent famine and disease outbreaks. This tragedy underscored the danger of living in flood-prone areas without adequate precautions.]]></media:description>
